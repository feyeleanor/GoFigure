GoFigure is a trivial templating tool built using Hoisie's mustache package.
See http://github.com/hoisie/mustache.go for further details.

Rules are specified on the command-line as follows:

	gofigure -i="template.mustache" "somekey -> somevalue" ...

and in the absence of an input file standard input is used as the template file.
